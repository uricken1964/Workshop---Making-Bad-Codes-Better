# Workshop - Making Bad Codes Better
This repository contains all codes for my workshop "Making Bad Codes Better" which deals with several real world examples of bad written SQL Code
All scripts are created for the use of Microsoft SQL Server (Version 2016 or higher)
To work with the scripts it is required to have the workshop database [ERP_Demo](https://www.db-berater.de/downloads/ERP_DEMO_2012.BAK) installed on your SQL Server Instance.
The last version of the demo database can be downloaded here:

Workshop Scripts for SQL Server Workshop "Making Bad Codes Better"

# Folder structure
+ Each scenario is stored in a separate folder (e.g. Scenario 01 in Folder Scenario 01)
+ All scripts have numbers and basically the script with the prefix 01 is for the preparation of the environment
+ The folder **Windows Admin Center** contains json files with the configuration of performance counter. These files can only be used with Windows Admin Center
  - [Windows Admin Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/windows-admin-center)
+ The folder **SQL Query Stress** contains prepared configuration settings for each scenario which produce load test with SQLQueryStress from Adam Machanic

# Scenario 01
The development team love to work with user definied functions (UDF).
So they decided to create an UDF which calculates the status of any customer by year.
The calculation is a simple math:

+ A customer: More or equal than 20 orders in a given year
+ B customer: 10 - 19 orders for a given year
+ C customer: 05 - 09 orders for a given year
+ D customer: 01 - 04 orders for a given year
+ Z customer: no orders for a given year
