# Workshop - Making Bad Codes Better
This repository contains all codes for my workshop "Making Bad Codes Better" which deals with several real world examples of bad written SQL Code
All scripts are created for the use of Microsoft SQL Server (Version 2016 or higher)
To work with the scripts it is required to have the workshop database ERP_Demo installed on your SQL Server Instance.
The last version of the demo database can be downloaded here:
