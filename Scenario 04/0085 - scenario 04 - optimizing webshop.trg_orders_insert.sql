	File:		0084 - scenario 04 - optimizing webshop.trg_orders_insert.sql

	Summary:	The stored proc has two problems:
				- the EXCEPT clause in the statement can lead to un unstable plan
					if statistics are not updated!
				- there is an unnecessary output which does not help with the
					insert statement!

				THIS SCRIPT IS PART OF THE WORKSHOP:
					"Performance optimization by identifying and correcting bad SQL code"

	Date:		October 2024
	Revion:		November 2024
