	Problemdescription:

	The development team love to work with user definied functions (UDF).
	So they decided to create an UDF which calculates the status of any customer by year.
	The calculation is a simple math:

	+ A customer: More or equal than 20 orders in a given year
	+ B customer: 10 - 19 orders for a given year
	+ C customer: 05 - 09 orders for a given year
	+ D customer: 01 - 04 orders for a given year
	+ Z customer: no orders for a given year

	Summary:	This script prepares tables in the database ERP_Demo
				for the chapter
				- bad code - usage of functions
				
				THIS SCRIPT IS PART OF THE WORKSHOP:
					"Workshop - Making Bad Codes better"
